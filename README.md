# CSSE7030
Course practise from CSSE7030, University of Queensland

This repository is my first try on Github, which contains all code from the assignment in CSSE7030.

There are three assignments:

  1. Sudo Mario Bros: Run a1.py to play
  2. Sleeping Coder: Run gui.py to play
  3. Mario Games: Run with valid config (default: config.txt)
  
For more details about those projects, please check the pdf.

If you are a UQ student, please do not copy the code for your assignment.

Finally, great thanks to all the tutors for their great help with my learning in Python.
