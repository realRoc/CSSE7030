"""CSSE1001 Game Engine

The CSSE1001 Game Engine has been developed by the tutors for the course
to provide a base for the development of various different assignment games.

Special thanks for Benjamin Martin and Paul Haley for the initial development
of this game engine.

The Game Engine depends on the pymunk python physics library and renders games
using the tkinter library.
